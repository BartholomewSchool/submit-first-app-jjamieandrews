I may have bitten off more than I could chew with OOP, it was abitious, but I was almost there! However there are two problems which I have indicated.

Nonetheless here is my code for my first application project in c++

This will need a downloadable application with a compiler for c++ to run this code. An application which manages user input one by one when called

So running this code on the web will not do im afraid. Visual studio with c++ downloads is recomended on the internet.
